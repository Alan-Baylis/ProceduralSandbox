A procedural maze generator for Unity

I present to you my Masters Project, an originial maze generator for Unity.

The generator is a three step algorithm. 
1. Create a randomized cluster of cells on a numeric grid.
2. Determine adjacency of the cells using product of primes.
3. Instantiate rooms and hallways.

To view the final version of the algorithm in action, load TheDungeon.unity.
